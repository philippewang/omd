(** Lexer's tokens. If you want to use the parser with an extended
    lexer, you may use the constructor [Tag] to implement
    the parser's extension. In the parser, [Tag] is used (at least)
    3 times in order to represent metadata or to store data.

    The integers carried by constructors means that the represented
    character appears (n+2) times. So, [Ampersand(0)] is "&&".
    Notably, this allows to use the property that in the match
    case [Ampersand _ ->], we know there are at least 2 ampersands.
    This is particularly useful for some characters, such as newlines
    and spaces. It's not useful for all of them indeed but it has
    been designed this way for the sake of uniformity (one doesn't
    want to know by heart which constructor have that "at least 2"
    property and which haven't).

(** - [parser_extension] is a method that takes the current state of the
    parser's data and returns None if nothing has been changed,
    otherwise it returns the new state.  The current state of the
    parser's data is [(r, p, l)] where [r] is the result so far, [p]
    is the list of the previous tokens (it's typically empty or
    contains information on how many newlines we've just seen), and
    [l] is the remaining tokens to parse.
    - and [to_string] is a method that returns directly a string
    representation of the object (it's normal if it returns the
    empty string). *)

(** One must use this type to extend the parser. It's a list of
    functions of type [extension]. They are processed in order (the
    head is applied first), so be careful about it. If you use it
    wrong, it will behave wrong. *)

val empty_extension : extension

val loose_compare : t -> t -> int
(** [loose_compare t1 t2] returns [0] if [t1] and [t2]
    are equivalent, otherwise it returns another number. *)

val normalise_md : t -> t
(** [normalise_md md] returns a copy of [md] where some elements
    have been factorized. *)

val visit : (element -> t option) -> t -> t
(** visitor for structures of type t: [visit f md] will return a new
    potentially altered copy of [md] that has been created by the
    visit of [md] by [f].

    The function [f] takes each [element] (from [md]) and returns
    [Some t] if it has effectively been applied to [element], and
    [None] otherwise. When it returns [Some t], [t] replaces [element]
    in the copy of [md], and when it returns [None], either [element]
    is copied as it is in the copy of [md] or a visited version is
    copied instead (well, that depends on if [element] has elements
    inside of it or not).
